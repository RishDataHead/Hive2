Will the reducer work or not if you use “Limit 1” in any HiveQL query?

Yes the reducer will work.
The "LIMIT" clause is applied after the mapper and the reducer have finished their tasks. It specifies the number of rows or records that should be returned from the query result. In the case of "LIMIT 1," it means only a single row or record should be returned.


Suppose I have installed Apache Hive on top of my Hadoop cluster using default metastore configuration. Then, what will happen if we have multiple clients trying to access Hive at the same time? 

The default metastore configuration allows only one Hive session to be opened at a time for accessing the metastore. Therefore, if multiple clients try to access the metastore at the same time, they will get an error.


Suppose, I create a table that contains details of all the transactions done by the customers: CREATE TABLE transaction_details (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, month STRING, country STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ;
Now, after inserting 50,000 records in this table, I want to know the total revenue generated for each month. But, Hive is taking too much time in processing this query. How will you solve this problem and list the steps that I will be taking in order to do so?


We can add Partitioning by month in order to reduce query time.
This can be done by using this syntax ALTER TABLE transaction_details ADD PARTITION (month='January');

How can you add a new partition for the month December in the above partitioned table?

 ALTER TABLE transaction_details ADD PARTITION (month='December');

I am inserting data into a table based on partitions dynamically. But, I received an error – FAILED ERROR IN SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: Dynamic partition strict mode requires at least one static partition column. How will you remove this error?

We can use this command to remove the error
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;


Suppose, I have a CSV file – ‘sample.csv’ present in ‘/temp’ directory with the following entries:
id first_name last_name email gender ip_address
How will you consume this CSV file into the Hive warehouse using built-in SerDe?

1)Upload the CSV file to HDFS.

2)Create a Hive table with the following schema:
CREATE TABLE sample (
  id INT,
  first_name STRING,
  last_name STRING,
  email STRING,
  gender STRING,
  ip_address STRING
) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde' STORED AS TEXTFILE;

3)Now load data using:
LOAD DATA INPATH '/temp/sample.csv' INTO TABLE sample;


Suppose, I have a lot of small CSV files present in the input directory in HDFS and I want to create a single Hive table corresponding to these files. The data in these files are in the format: {id, name, e-mail, country}. Now, as we know, Hadoop performance degrades when we use lots of small files.
So, how will you solve this problem where we want to create a single Hive table for lots of small files without degrading the performance of the system?

By consolidating the small CSV files, converting them to the SequenceFile format, and loading the data into a Hive external table, you can significantly improve performance. This approach reduces the number of input files, improves data compression, and enables Hive to optimize query execution efficiently.

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH ‘Home/country/state/’
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE address;

The following statement failed to execute. What can be the cause?

The following statement failed to execute because the LOAD DATA statement cannot load data from a local path into a Hive table. The LOAD DATA statement can only load data from HDFS or other Hadoop-supported file systems.




Yes, it is possible to add 100 nodes to a Hive cluster that already has 100 nodes. To do this, you will need to:

Install Hive on the new nodes.
Configure the new nodes to join the Hive cluster.
Update the Hive configuration to reflect the new number of nodes.
